# Testing and Readiness

This page is informed by shared readiness/test strategy docs in `laakhay-dev/docs`.

## Testing Layers Relevant to Quantlab

- static checks (lint/type/security)
- unit tests for pure research transforms
- integration tests with real data contracts
- replay/e2e scenarios for experiment determinism

## Minimum Bar Before Promotion

A research artifact should not move forward unless:

- tests are deterministic
- assumptions and constraints are documented
- dependency versions are pinned
- compatibility with downstream runtime contracts is validated

## Operational Readiness Hooks

From production readiness guidance:

- CI gates for regressions
- artifact versioning
- observability hooks when promoted to service runtime
- rollback path when real-time behavior diverges from replay
