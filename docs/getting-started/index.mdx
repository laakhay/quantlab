# Getting Started

Use this path for a clean first setup:

1. Install with at least one backend extra.
2. Verify backend availability and default selection.
3. Run a small backend-op example.
4. Generate GBM paths and terminal values.

If you are using JAX, include explicit PRNG keys in sampling/simulation calls.
