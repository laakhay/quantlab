# Architecture Direction

This direction is aligned with shared system docs in `laakhay-dev/docs` and package boundaries.

## Layering

1. Data acquisition and normalization via `laakhay-data`
2. Signal/feature logic via `laakhay-ta`
3. Research orchestration and experiment state in `quantlab`
4. Promotion of validated logic into runtime services

## Key Design Constraints

- deterministic experiment replay
- explicit versioning of inputs and parameter sets
- serializable research artifacts for review
- clear handoff from research to deployment pipeline

## Interface Contracts

Quantlab should consume stable contracts, not private internals, from sibling packages:

- documented API surfaces
- pinned package versions
- compatibility checks in CI
