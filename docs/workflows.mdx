# Research Workflows

A practical baseline workflow for Quantlab teams:

## 1. Define Hypothesis

State a measurable claim (signal quality, risk profile, stability under regime shifts).

## 2. Define Inputs

- universe and symbol scope
- timeframe and data sources
- warmup/lookback requirements

## 3. Build Signal Logic

Compose indicator and expression logic with explicit parameter sets.

## 4. Run Evaluation

- offline replay on bounded windows
- stress windows for volatility and liquidity shifts
- sanity checks for missing-data behavior

## 5. Record Outcomes

Persist:

- strategy/feature definition
- dataset fingerprint
- metrics and failure modes
- decision (iterate, reject, promote)

## 6. Promote or Iterate

Only promote artifacts with reproducible results and stable behavior.
