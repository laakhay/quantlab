# Overview

Current repository metadata is intentionally minimal, but the surrounding Laakhay docs provide enough signal for a concrete Quantlab direction.

## Position in the Ecosystem

Quantlab sits between:

- foundational market-data access (`laakhay-data`)
- technical-analysis and expression runtime (`laakhay-ta`)
- production services/orchestration (`kendra`)

## Primary Goal

Make research reproducible and structured so strategy ideas do not stay notebook fragments.

## Expected Capabilities

- experiment setup templates
- input dataset definitions
- indicator/expression experimentation loops
- evaluation and validation harnesses
- promotion path from research artifact to production candidate
