# PyTorch Backend

`TorchBackend` maps backend protocol methods to `torch` and `torch.linalg`.

Highlights:

- CPU and CUDA device support
- tensor-first workflow for model-adjacent quant systems
- backend-compatible random, linalg, and special function support

Operational notes:

- device movement is explicit through `to_device`
- backend conversion to/from NumPy is available for bridge workflows
