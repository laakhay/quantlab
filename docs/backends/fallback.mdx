# Fallback Backend

`FallbackBackend` is a fail-fast guard used when no real backend is installed.

Behavior:

- always registered
- resolves method access to a runtime error with installation guidance
- not suitable for computation

If fallback is your default backend, install at least one real backend extra (`numpy`, `jax`, or `torch`).
