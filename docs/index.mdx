# Laakhay Quantlab

`laakhay-quantlab` is a backend-agnostic quantitative compute layer for simulation-heavy research and production analytics.

## At A Glance

- Unified backend protocol over NumPy, JAX, and PyTorch.
- Runtime backend registry, inference, and array conversion.
- Compact ops facade for backend-dispatched math and reductions.
- Autodiff/JIT/vectorization helpers via `ArrayBackend`.
- Simulation primitives: Gaussian sampler and Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM).

## Ecosystem Position

- `laakhay-data`: market data acquisition and normalization.
- `laakhay-ta`: indicator and strategy expression engine.
- `laakhay-quantlab`: numerical simulation and backend-accelerated quant compute.

Typical flow: `data -> ta -> quantlab` for calibration, risk, and scenario simulation.

## Package Info

- Package: `laakhay-quantlab`
- Python: `>=3.10`
- Extras: `numpy`, `jax`, `jax-gpu`, `torch`, `all`
