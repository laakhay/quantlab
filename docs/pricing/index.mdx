# Pricing & Derivatives

The `pricing` module provides a comprehensive framework for modeling, pricing, and analyzing financial derivatives. It supports both analytical (closed-form) and numerical (Monte Carlo) pricing methods, along with first-order and second-order Greeks calculation.

## Core Components

The pricing engine is built around three primary abstractions:

1. **Market Data** (`MarketData`): Encapsulates the state of the market (spot price, volatility, interest rates).
2. **Instrument** (`OptionContract`, `OptionLeg`): Defines the financial payoff structure.
3. **Pricer** (`Pricer`): Executes the pricing logic using a specific method/backend.

## Quick Example

```python
from laakhay.quantlab.pricing import MarketData, EuropeanCall, Pricer, PricingMethod

# 1. Market State
market = MarketData(spot=100.0, rate=0.05, vol=0.2)

# 2. Instrument
call = EuropeanCall(strike=100.0, expiry=1.0)

# 3. Price
pricer = Pricer(method=PricingMethod.BLACK_SCHOLES)
price = pricer.price(call, market)
```
