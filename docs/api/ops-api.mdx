# Ops API

`laakhay.quantlab.backend.ops` is a convenience facade over inferred backend dispatch.

Use it when you want concise operator calls without manually carrying an `ArrayBackend` object.

## Example

```python
from laakhay.quantlab.backend.ops import add, mul, mean, std

z = add(x, y)
w = mul(z, z)
mu = mean(w)
sigma = std(w)
```

## Notes

- All arrays in one operation path should belong to the same backend.
- Mixed-backend arrays raise `MixedBackendError` from registry inference.
- For explicit control, prefer direct `ArrayBackend` methods.

For full ops method list, see `api/inventory`.
