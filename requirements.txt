# Core dependencies for laakhay-quantlab
# These are the minimal runtime requirements

# Optional array backends (install at least one)
# numpy>=1.21.0
# jax[cpu]>=0.4.0  # For CPU-only JAX
# jax[cuda]>=0.4.0  # For GPU-enabled JAX  
# torch>=2.0.0      # For PyTorch backend

# Note: At least one backend (numpy, jax, or torch) must be installed
# for the library to function. Install the backend(s) that match your needs:
# - numpy: Simple CPU-only computations, no autodiff
# - jax: GPU support, autodiff, JIT compilation
# - torch: GPU support, autodiff
